## SOURCE_FILE: references\request-mocking.md
# Request Mocking

Intercept, mock, modify, and block network requests.

## CLI Route Commands

```bash
# Mock with custom status
playwright-cli route "**/*.jpg" --status=404

# Mock with JSON body
playwright-cli route "**/api/users" --body='[{"id":1,"name":"Alice"}]' --content-type=application/json

# Mock with custom headers
playwright-cli route "**/api/data" --body='{"ok":true}' --header="X-Custom: value"

# Remove headers from requests
playwright-cli route "**/*" --remove-header=cookie,authorization

# List active routes
playwright-cli route-list

# Remove a route or all routes
playwright-cli unroute "**/*.jpg"
playwright-cli unroute
```

## URL Patterns

```
**/api/users           - Exact path match
**/api/*/details       - Wildcard in path
**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg}    - Match file extensions
**/search?q=*          - Match query parameters
```

## Advanced Mocking with run-code

For conditional responses, request body inspection, response modification, or delays:

### Conditional Response Based on Request

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.route('**/api/login', route => {
    const body = route.request().postDataJSON();
    if (body.username === 'admin') {
      route.fulfill({ body: JSON.stringify({ token: 'mock-token' }) });
    } else {
      route.fulfill({ status: 401, body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Invalid' }) });
    }
  });
}"
```

### Modify Real Response

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.route('**/api/user', async route => {
    const response = await route.fetch();
    const json = await response.json();
    json.isPremium = true;
    await route.fulfill({ response, json });
  });
}"
```

### Simulate Network Failures

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.route('**/api/offline', route => route.abort('internetdisconnected'));
}"
# Options: connectionrefused, timedout, connectionreset, internetdisconnected
```

### Delayed Response

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.route('**/api/slow', async route => {
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 3000));
    route.fulfill({ body: JSON.stringify({ data: 'loaded' }) });
  });
}"
```

## SOURCE_FILE: references\running-code.md
# Running Custom Playwright Code

Use `run-code` to execute arbitrary Playwright code for advanced scenarios not covered by CLI commands.

## Syntax

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  // Your Playwright code here
  // Access page.context() for browser context operations
}"
```

## Geolocation

```bash
# Grant geolocation permission and set location
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation']);
  await page.context().setGeolocation({ latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 });
}"

# Set location to London
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation']);
  await page.context().setGeolocation({ latitude: 51.5074, longitude: -0.1278 });
}"

# Clear geolocation override
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().clearPermissions();
}"
```

## Permissions

```bash
# Grant multiple permissions
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions([
    'geolocation',
    'notifications',
    'camera',
    'microphone'
  ]);
}"

# Grant permissions for specific origin
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions(['clipboard-read'], {
    origin: 'https://example.com'
  });
}"
```

## Media Emulation

```bash
# Emulate dark color scheme
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.emulateMedia({ colorScheme: 'dark' });
}"

# Emulate light color scheme
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.emulateMedia({ colorScheme: 'light' });
}"

# Emulate reduced motion
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.emulateMedia({ reducedMotion: 'reduce' });
}"

# Emulate print media
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.emulateMedia({ media: 'print' });
}"
```

## Wait Strategies

```bash
# Wait for network idle
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
}"

# Wait for specific element
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.waitForSelector('.loading', { state: 'hidden' });
}"

# Wait for function to return true
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.waitForFunction(() => window.appReady === true);
}"

# Wait with timeout
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.waitForSelector('.result', { timeout: 10000 });
}"
```

## Frames and Iframes

```bash
# Work with iframe
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  const frame = page.locator('iframe#my-iframe').contentFrame();
  await frame.locator('button').click();
}"

# Get all frames
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  const frames = page.frames();
  return frames.map(f => f.url());
}"
```

## File Downloads

```bash
# Handle file download
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  const [download] = await Promise.all([
    page.waitForEvent('download'),
    page.click('a.download-link')
  ]);
  await download.saveAs('./downloaded-file.pdf');
  return download.suggestedFilename();
}"
```

## Clipboard

```bash
# Read clipboard (requires permission)
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions(['clipboard-read']);
  return await page.evaluate(() => navigator.clipboard.readText());
}"

# Write to clipboard
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.evaluate(text => navigator.clipboard.writeText(text), 'Hello clipboard!');
}"
```

## Page Information

```bash
# Get page title
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  return await page.title();
}"

# Get current URL
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  return page.url();
}"

# Get page content
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  return await page.content();
}"

# Get viewport size
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  return page.viewportSize();
}"
```

## JavaScript Execution

```bash
# Execute JavaScript and return result
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  return await page.evaluate(() => {
    return {
      userAgent: navigator.userAgent,
      language: navigator.language,
      cookiesEnabled: navigator.cookieEnabled
    };
  });
}"

# Pass arguments to evaluate
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  const multiplier = 5;
  return await page.evaluate(m => document.querySelectorAll('li').length * m, multiplier);
}"
```

## Error Handling

```bash
# Try-catch in run-code
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  try {
    await page.click('.maybe-missing', { timeout: 1000 });
    return 'clicked';
  } catch (e) {
    return 'element not found';
  }
}"
```

## Complex Workflows

```bash
# Login and save state
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com/login');
  await page.fill('input[name=email]', 'user@example.com');
  await page.fill('input[name=password]', 'secret');
  await page.click('button[type=submit]');
  await page.waitForURL('**/dashboard');
  await page.context().storageState({ path: 'auth.json' });
  return 'Login successful';
}"

# Scrape data from multiple pages
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  const results = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    await page.goto(\`https://example.com/page/\${i}\`);
    const items = await page.locator('.item').allTextContents();
    results.push(...items);
  }
  return results;
}"
```

## SOURCE_FILE: references\session-management.md
# Browser Session Management

Run multiple isolated browser sessions concurrently with state persistence.

## Named Browser Sessions

Use `-b` flag to isolate browser contexts:

```bash
# Browser 1: Authentication flow
playwright-cli -s=auth open https://app.example.com/login

# Browser 2: Public browsing (separate cookies, storage)
playwright-cli -s=public open https://example.com

# Commands are isolated by browser session
playwright-cli -s=auth fill e1 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli -s=public snapshot
```

## Browser Session Isolation Properties

Each browser session has independent:
- Cookies
- LocalStorage / SessionStorage
- IndexedDB
- Cache
- Browsing history
- Open tabs

## Browser Session Commands

```bash
# List all browser sessions
playwright-cli list

# Stop a browser session (close the browser)
playwright-cli close                # stop the default browser
playwright-cli -s=mysession close   # stop a named browser

# Stop all browser sessions
playwright-cli close-all

# Forcefully kill all daemon processes (for stale/zombie processes)
playwright-cli kill-all

# Delete browser session user data (profile directory)
playwright-cli delete-data                # delete default browser data
playwright-cli -s=mysession delete-data   # delete named browser data
```

## Environment Variable

Set a default browser session name via environment variable:

```bash
export PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION="mysession"
playwright-cli open example.com  # Uses "mysession" automatically
```

## Common Patterns

### Concurrent Scraping

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Scrape multiple sites concurrently

# Start all browsers
playwright-cli -s=site1 open https://site1.com &
playwright-cli -s=site2 open https://site2.com &
playwright-cli -s=site3 open https://site3.com &
wait

# Take snapshots from each
playwright-cli -s=site1 snapshot
playwright-cli -s=site2 snapshot
playwright-cli -s=site3 snapshot

# Cleanup
playwright-cli close-all
```

### A/B Testing Sessions

```bash
# Test different user experiences
playwright-cli -s=variant-a open "https://app.com?variant=a"
playwright-cli -s=variant-b open "https://app.com?variant=b"

# Compare
playwright-cli -s=variant-a screenshot
playwright-cli -s=variant-b screenshot
```

### Persistent Profile

By default, browser profile is kept in memory only. Use `--persistent` flag on `open` to persist the browser profile to disk:

```bash
# Use persistent profile (auto-generated location)
playwright-cli open https://example.com --persistent

# Use persistent profile with custom directory
playwright-cli open https://example.com --profile=/path/to/profile
```

## Default Browser Session

When `-s` is omitted, commands use the default browser session:

```bash
# These use the same default browser session
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close  # Stops default browser
```

## Browser Session Configuration

Configure a browser session with specific settings when opening:

```bash
# Open with config file
playwright-cli open https://example.com --config=.playwright/my-cli.json

# Open with specific browser
playwright-cli open https://example.com --browser=firefox

# Open in headed mode
playwright-cli open https://example.com --headed

# Open with persistent profile
playwright-cli open https://example.com --persistent
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Name Browser Sessions Semantically

```bash
# GOOD: Clear purpose
playwright-cli -s=github-auth open https://github.com
playwright-cli -s=docs-scrape open https://docs.example.com

# AVOID: Generic names
playwright-cli -s=s1 open https://github.com
```

### 2. Always Clean Up

```bash
# Stop browsers when done
playwright-cli -s=auth close
playwright-cli -s=scrape close

# Or stop all at once
playwright-cli close-all

# If browsers become unresponsive or zombie processes remain
playwright-cli kill-all
```

### 3. Delete Stale Browser Data

```bash
# Remove old browser data to free disk space
playwright-cli -s=oldsession delete-data
```



---
## SOURCE_FILE: references\storage-state.md
# Storage Management

Manage cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, and browser storage state.

## Storage State

Save and restore complete browser state including cookies and storage.

### Save Storage State

```bash
# Save to auto-generated filename (storage-state-{timestamp}.json)
playwright-cli state-save

# Save to specific filename
playwright-cli state-save my-auth-state.json
```

### Restore Storage State

```bash
# Load storage state from file
playwright-cli state-load my-auth-state.json

# Reload page to apply cookies
playwright-cli open https://example.com
```

### Storage State File Format

The saved file contains:

```json
{
  "cookies": [
    {
      "name": "session_id",
      "value": "abc123",
      "domain": "example.com",
      "path": "/",
      "expires": 1735689600,
      "httpOnly": true,
      "secure": true,
      "sameSite": "Lax"
    }
  ],
  "origins": [
    {
      "origin": "https://example.com",
      "localStorage": [
        { "name": "theme", "value": "dark" },
        { "name": "user_id", "value": "12345" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Cookies

### List All Cookies

```bash
playwright-cli cookie-list
```

### Filter Cookies by Domain

```bash
playwright-cli cookie-list --domain=example.com
```

### Filter Cookies by Path

```bash
playwright-cli cookie-list --path=/api
```

### Get Specific Cookie

```bash
playwright-cli cookie-get session_id
```

### Set a Cookie

```bash
# Basic cookie
playwright-cli cookie-set session abc123

# Cookie with options
playwright-cli cookie-set session abc123 --domain=example.com --path=/ --httpOnly --secure --sameSite=Lax

# Cookie with expiration (Unix timestamp)
playwright-cli cookie-set remember_me token123 --expires=1735689600
```

### Delete a Cookie

```bash
playwright-cli cookie-delete session_id
```

### Clear All Cookies

```bash
playwright-cli cookie-clear
```

### Advanced: Multiple Cookies or Custom Options

For complex scenarios like adding multiple cookies at once, use `run-code`:

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.context().addCookies([
    { name: 'session_id', value: 'sess_abc123', domain: 'example.com', path: '/', httpOnly: true },
    { name: 'preferences', value: JSON.stringify({ theme: 'dark' }), domain: 'example.com', path: '/' }
  ]);
}"
```

## Local Storage

### List All localStorage Items

```bash
playwright-cli localstorage-list
```

### Get Single Value

```bash
playwright-cli localstorage-get token
```

### Set Value

```bash
playwright-cli localstorage-set theme dark
```

### Set JSON Value

```bash
playwright-cli localstorage-set user_settings '{"theme":"dark","language":"en"}'
```

### Delete Single Item

```bash
playwright-cli localstorage-delete token
```

### Clear All localStorage

```bash
playwright-cli localstorage-clear
```

### Advanced: Multiple Operations

For complex scenarios like setting multiple values at once, use `run-code`:

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    localStorage.setItem('token', 'jwt_abc123');
    localStorage.setItem('user_id', '12345');
    localStorage.setItem('expires_at', Date.now() + 3600000);
  });
}"
```

## Session Storage

### List All sessionStorage Items

```bash
playwright-cli sessionstorage-list
```

### Get Single Value

```bash
playwright-cli sessionstorage-get form_data
```

### Set Value

```bash
playwright-cli sessionstorage-set step 3
```

### Delete Single Item

```bash
playwright-cli sessionstorage-delete step
```

### Clear sessionStorage

```bash
playwright-cli sessionstorage-clear
```

## IndexedDB

### List Databases

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  return await page.evaluate(async () => {
    const databases = await indexedDB.databases();
    return databases;
  });
}"
```

### Delete Database

```bash
playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    indexedDB.deleteDatabase('myDatabase');
  });
}"
```

## Common Patterns

### Authentication State Reuse

```bash
# Step 1: Login and save state
playwright-cli open https://app.example.com/login
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
playwright-cli click e3

# Save the authenticated state
playwright-cli state-save auth.json

# Step 2: Later, restore state and skip login
playwright-cli state-load auth.json
playwright-cli open https://app.example.com/dashboard
# Already logged in!
```

### Save and Restore Roundtrip

```bash
# Set up authentication state
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli eval "() => { document.cookie = 'session=abc123'; localStorage.setItem('user', 'john'); }"

# Save state to file
playwright-cli state-save my-session.json

# ... later, in a new session ...

# Restore state
playwright-cli state-load my-session.json
playwright-cli open https://example.com
# Cookies and localStorage are restored!
```

## Security Notes

- Never commit storage state files containing auth tokens
- Add `*.auth-state.json` to `.gitignore`
- Delete state files after automation completes
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- By default, sessions run in-memory mode which is safer for sensitive operations

## SOURCE_FILE: references\test-generation.md
# Test Generation

Generate Playwright test code automatically as you interact with the browser.

## How It Works

Every action you perform with `playwright-cli` generates corresponding Playwright TypeScript code.
This code appears in the output and can be copied directly into your test files.

After completing a CLI session, the system will automatically create a test file in the `e2e/tests` directory with the generated code, requiring no manual copying or file creation.
## Automatic Test Recording Process

After successfully running Playwright CLI commands, the system should automatically record your test steps in the `e2e/tests` folder:

1. Run your Playwright CLI session and perform the desired actions
2. The CLI will capture all actions as Playwright code
3. Upon completion of the session, the CLI will automatically create a new test file in the `e2e/tests` directory with the generated code
4. The test file will include appropriate test descriptions and assertions based on the actions performed
5. The file will be named descriptively based on the actions performed during the session


## Example Workflow

```bash
# Start a session
playwright-cli open https://example.com/login

# Take a snapshot to see elements
playwright-cli snapshot
# Output shows: e1 [textbox "Email"], e2 [textbox "Password"], e3 [button "Sign In"]

# Fill form fields - generates code automatically
playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
# Ran Playwright code:
# await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Email' }).fill('user@example.com');

playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
# Ran Playwright code:
# await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Password' }).fill('password123');

playwright-cli click e3
# Ran Playwright code:
# await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign In' }).click();

# Complete the session and automatically create test file
playwright-cli create-test --name "flow-test"
# Automatically creates: e2e/tests/flow-test.spec.ts with all the generated code
```

## Building a Test File

Collect the generated code into a Playwright test:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('login flow', async ({ page }) => {
  // Generated code from playwright-cli session:
  await page.goto('https://example.com/login');
  await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Email' }).fill('user@example.com');
  await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Password' }).fill('password123');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign In' }).click();

  // Add assertions
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*dashboard/);
});
```

## Automatic Test Creation Implementation

To enable automatic test file creation after running Playwright CLI commands, implement the following:

1. After completing your CLI session, use a command like:
```bash
playwright-cli create-test --name "my-test-description" --output-dir "e2e/tests/"
```

2. This command will:
   - Capture the generated code from your CLI session
   - Create a properly formatted test file in the specified directory
   - Include appropriate imports and test structure
   - Name the file descriptively based on your session

3. Example of the automatic process:
```bash
# Run your CLI session
playwright-cli open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc
# ... perform your actions ...
# Create the test file automatically
playwright-cli create-test --name "todomvc-add-todo-flow"
# Creates: e2e/tests/todomvc-add-todo-flow.spec.ts
```


## Best Practices

### 4. Automatic Test Recording in e2e/tests Folder
After successfully running Playwright CLI commands and generating test code, automatically save the generated test steps to the `e2e/tests` folder for future use:

```bash
# After completing your Playwright CLI session, collect the generated code
# and save it as a new test file in the e2e/tests directory:
playwright-cli open https://example.com
# ... perform actions that generate code ...
# Then create a test file with the generated code:
# Copy the generated code from the CLI output and create a new file:
# e2e/tests/generated-test-name.spec.ts
```

Example of saving generated test code to the proper location:

```typescript
// Save as e2e/tests/cli-generated-flow.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('automatically recorded flow from CLI', async ({ page }) => {
  // Paste the code generated by playwright-cli here:
  await page.goto('https://example.com/login');
  await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Email' }).fill('user@example.com');
  await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Password' }).fill('password123');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign In' }).click();

  // Add assertions as needed
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*dashboard/);
});
```


### 1. Use Semantic Locators

The generated code uses role-based locators when possible, which are more resilient:

```typescript
// Generated (good - semantic)
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }).click();

// Avoid (fragile - CSS selectors)
await page.locator('#submit-btn').click();
```

### 2. Explore Before Recording

Take snapshots to understand the page structure before recording actions:

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli snapshot
# Review the element structure
playwright-cli click e5
```

### 3. Add Assertions Manually

Generated code captures actions but not assertions. Add expectations in your test:

```typescript
// Generated action
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }).click();

// Manual assertion
await expect(page.getByText('Success')).toBeVisible();
```


### 4. Automatic Test Recording Workflow

For a more automated approach to recording your test steps in the `e2e/tests` folder after successful Playwright CLI execution, you can create a helper script that will automatically save the generated code to the appropriate location. Here's how to implement this automation in your workflow:

1. Plan your test scenario before starting the CLI session
2. Execute your test steps using Playwright CLI commands
3. After completing your session, the CLI will output all the generated Playwright code
4. Create a script or function that captures this output and saves it automatically to `e2e/tests/` with a descriptive filename
5. The script should format the code properly with imports and test structure
6. Run the automation script after your CLI session to create the test file

Example automation script concept (to be implemented in your CLI workflow):
```bash
# After your Playwright CLI session completes, run this command to auto-generate the test file
playwright-cli save-test --name "todomvc-add-todo" --description "Add todo flow on TodoMVC"
# This would automatically create e2e/tests/todomvc-add-todo.spec.ts with the captured steps
```

## SOURCE_FILE: references\tracing.md
# Tracing

Capture detailed execution traces for debugging and analysis. Traces include DOM snapshots, screenshots, network activity, and console logs.

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Start trace recording
playwright-cli tracing-start

# Perform actions
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli click e1
playwright-cli fill e2 "test"

# Stop trace recording
playwright-cli tracing-stop
```

## Trace Output Files

When you start tracing, Playwright creates a `traces/` directory with several files:

### `trace-{timestamp}.trace`

**Action log** - The main trace file containing:
- Every action performed (clicks, fills, navigations)
- DOM snapshots before and after each action
- Screenshots at each step
- Timing information
- Console messages
- Source locations

### `trace-{timestamp}.network`

**Network log** - Complete network activity:
- All HTTP requests and responses
- Request headers and bodies
- Response headers and bodies
- Timing (DNS, connect, TLS, TTFB, download)
- Resource sizes
- Failed requests and errors

### `resources/`

**Resources directory** - Cached resources:
- Images, fonts, stylesheets, scripts
- Response bodies for replay
- Assets needed to reconstruct page state

## What Traces Capture

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Actions** | Clicks, fills, hovers, keyboard input, navigations |
| **DOM** | Full DOM snapshot before/after each action |
| **Screenshots** | Visual state at each step |
| **Network** | All requests, responses, headers, bodies, timing |
| **Console** | All console.log, warn, error messages |
| **Timing** | Precise timing for each operation |

## Use Cases

### Debugging Failed Actions

```bash
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli open https://app.example.com

# This click fails - why?
playwright-cli click e5

playwright-cli tracing-stop
# Open trace to see DOM state when click was attempted
```

### Analyzing Performance

```bash
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli open https://slow-site.com
playwright-cli tracing-stop

# View network waterfall to identify slow resources
```

### Capturing Evidence

```bash
# Record a complete user flow for documentation
playwright-cli tracing-start

playwright-cli open https://app.example.com/checkout
playwright-cli fill e1 "4111111111111111"
playwright-cli fill e2 "12/25"
playwright-cli fill e3 "123"
playwright-cli click e4

playwright-cli tracing-stop
# Trace shows exact sequence of events
```

## Trace vs Video vs Screenshot

| Feature | Trace | Video | Screenshot |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| **Format** | .trace file | .webm video | .png/.jpeg image |
| **DOM inspection** | Yes | No | No |
| **Network details** | Yes | No | No |
| **Step-by-step replay** | Yes | Continuous | Single frame |
| **File size** | Medium | Large | Small |
| **Best for** | Debugging | Demos | Quick capture |

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Tracing Before the Problem

```bash
# Trace the entire flow, not just the failing step
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli open https://example.com
# ... all steps leading to the issue ...
playwright-cli tracing-stop
```

### 2. Clean Up Old Traces

Traces can consume significant disk space:

```bash
# Remove traces older than 7 days
find .playwright-cli/traces -mtime +7 -delete
```

## Limitations

- Traces add overhead to automation
- Large traces can consume significant disk space
- Some dynamic content may not replay perfectly
